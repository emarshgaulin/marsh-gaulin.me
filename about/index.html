                <h2 class="section-title">"Who am I?" has always been a complicated question.</h2>
                <img id="aboutme-img1" src="/resources/illustrated-headshot.png" alt="vector illustration of a woman with glasses and long brown hair">
                <p>I'm a stay-at-home-mom, I'm a graphic designer, I'm a community theater actor, I'm a marketer, I'm a mezzo-soprano, I'm a front-end developer. I went to business school because that's what was expected of me, then majored in marketing because I still wanted to be creative. I held several marketing roles after graduation that all held the same theme: I performed very well in the job tasks and emotionally burnt myself out beyond what my body could keep up.</p>
                <p>I did some internal exploration to try and find a sustainable path forward, and decided to explore more creative options at the local community college while still trying to make marketing work for me. I adored every art and design project I got my hands on. I was confident in making a creative career change.</p>
                <p>I was expecting a baby and living in a state with poor health outcomes for pregnant people, poor educational outcomes for public schoolchildren, and poor quality of life for children who might grow up LGBTQ+. My husband and I moved to Connecticut with one course left in my AAS in Digital Art and Design. I could do with a certificate instead of a degree for the health and safety of my new little family.</p>
                <p>My tiny newborn became an infant who became a toddler, and the timing never quite worked out to re-enter the workforce. I needed time to work on my website and portfolio and resume, so I needed childcare to get that time, so I needed a job to pay for that childcare, so I needed a new website and portfolio and resume to get that job. The most I could manage was a little training here and there to keep my skills sharp &mdash; my husband works for a technology training company, I'd just go through some of that, since I have access anyway.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">That's how I ended up here, I guess.</h2>
                <p>Since my son has discovered independent play, and since I've been able to find efficiencies in my time management, I've carved out just enough time to get back into the professional world. I enrolled at Harvard Extension School with the goal of achieving a Master's degree in Digital Media Design, and I'm now looking for a digital- or web-focused graphic design role in which I can use my creative workflow, technical knowledge, and marketing experience.</p>
                <p>While, like many graphic designers, I love creating beautiful projects, my business-side background keeps my designs oriented towards your KPI goals. I am passionate about learning and problem-solving, and I'd be thrilled to collaborate with you to make something valuable.</p>
