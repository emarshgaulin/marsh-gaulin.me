                <p class="body-copy">Whether visual or verbal, commercial or fine art, every piece of content you've seen was made with an underlying purpose &mdash; to drive customer clicks in an email, to instruct employees in an internal briefing, to move an audience emotionally in a documentary.</p>
                <p class="body-copy">I partner with clients to identify a clear, specific goal for each project, from a single social post to an entire brand package. Who needs to see this? What should they feel when they see it? What should they do after it's seen?</p>
                <p class="body-copy">Once we establish project scope and limitations â€” medium, budget, existing visuals, et cetera &mdash; I get to do my favorite thing in the world, and I work through the problem-solving process in human-centric graphic design, copywriting, and web development.</p>
                <p class="body-copy">You then get to do your new favorite thing, and you'll work with a creative professional who hasn't forgotten her marketing roots.</p>
